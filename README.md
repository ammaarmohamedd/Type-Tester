# Typing Speed Tester

A Python-based program to test your typing speed and accuracy. Type the displayed sentence as fast as you can, and the program will calculate your Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and time taken.

## Features
- Measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).
- Calculates typing accuracy as a percentage.
- Randomly selects sentences to type.
- Option to retry the test after each attempt.
- Clean and interactive console-based interface.

## How It Works
1. A random sentence is displayed on the screen.
2. You type the sentence as quickly and accurately as possible.
3. The program calculates:
   - **Time Taken**: The duration from when you start typing to when you finish.
   - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Your typing speed in terms of words per minute.
   - **Accuracy**: How closely your typed text matches the original sentence.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-speed-tester.git
